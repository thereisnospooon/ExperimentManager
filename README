ExperimentManager is a tool to manage deep learning experiments. 
This include different architectures, datasets and hyperparameters.


    #### Classes ####

--- ExperimentManager ---
holds meta data about the entire project/experiment.
sits in a directory with subdirectories for each run of the experiment.

Methods -
1) __init__
2) run_experiment - need to get a model, iterator for batching, name of run
3) analyze_log - after experiment finished running this function analyzes the log according to metrics. Maybe abstract?
4) 


--- Experiment ---
Holds the current architecture, dataset, parameters, training log. sits in a directory below ExperimentManager.

Methods - 
1) run_train
2) run_test
3) get_stats - See statistics about experiment 



	#### Scripts ####
exps_manager.py: searches the directory that was called from for an ExperimentManager object and loads data about it.
